# How to handle functions

Sysadmin is currently the only user who is able to execute all functions/procedures, so using sysadmin for testing is advised.


If a function/procedure is not implemented on the DB, download the corresponding .sql and execute it. You can only do one at the time.
To see which ones are implemented atm in the Workbench under **Database-explorer -> procedures**.


To execute a procedure/function, see **How_To_Execute.sql**.


When adding functions, please extend the How-To accordingly.
